        <h2>Welcome to the GMSRA website!</h2>
        <p>
            The General Motors Salaried Retirement Association (GMSRA) is a
            non-profit organization that provides retirement benefits to
            former employees of General Motors (Salaried Division). The GMSRA Executive encourages all former General
            Motors Salaried Employees [including EDS and Contract Employees] who have retired, moved on to new life, or
            changed career paths to join the General Motors Salaried Retirees Association. This includes the folks who
            left due to plant closings or corporate restructuring.

        </p>
        <p>

            The General Motors Salaried Retirees Association was established in 1982. The Executive is elected and/or
            appointed every two years. We have members from coast to coast in Canada and the USA as well as
            international members from Australia. We feel our Association helps to “fill the gap” between regular GM
            employment days and local senior activities. Our members support many activities locally and nationally such
            as hospital fund raisers, food drives, children benefits. General Membership Meetings are held on the 2nd
            Tuesday of each month (except for June, July, August, and September) at the Woodview Park Community Centre,
            151 Cadillac Avenue North, Oshawa. From Noon to 1:00 PM is a social hour where you can meet and reminisce
            with friends and colleagues. The formal portion of the meeting starts at 1:00 PM and typically involves a
            presentation on a topic of interest by a guest speaker.
            In addition, GMSRA sponsors a Christmas Luncheon, Christmas Dance and outings to theatre performances,
            baseball games, etc.
